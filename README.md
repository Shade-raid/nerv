NERV Command System - Game Description
Genre: Strategic Management / Survival / Turn-Based Strategy
Not an idle/incremental game - This is an active turn-based strategy game where you make decisions each turn rather than passively watching numbers go up.

📋 OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION
NERV COMMAND SYSTEM v1.0
CLASSIFIED - CLEARANCE LEVEL 7 REQUIRED
OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT
You are the Commander of NERV, humanity's last defense against the Angels. But the threat isn't just extraterrestrial—SEELE, the shadowy committee that funds you, has their own agenda for humanity's future.
Command. Survive. Resist.
Balance the impossible: Keep your Evangelion units combat-ready. Prevent your child pilots from psychological collapse. Maintain funding from a UN that doesn't trust you. And resist SEELE's creeping control over your organization—all while fighting giant monsters that could end humanity.

🎮 CORE GAMEPLAY
MULTI-LAYERED STRATEGY

Manage 3 individual pilots with unique sync rates and mental health
Maintain 3 Eva units with degrading condition
Conduct research into AT-Fields, weapons, and autonomous systems
Navigate political pressures from SEELE, the UN, and the public

Defy SEELE to maintain autonomy, but lose critical support

💀 DIFFICULTY
BRUTAL AND UNFORGIVING
This is not a power fantasy. You will make hard choices. Pilots will suffer. Resources will be scarce. SEELE will tighten their grip. The question isn't whether you'll face crisis—it's whether you can survive it without losing your soul (or your organization).
Average survival: 15-30 days
Good commanders: 40+ days
Legendary runs: Defeat all 15 Angels while maintaining autonomy

🎨 ATMOSPHERE
Inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion's themes of institutional dysfunction, the crushing weight of responsibility, and the cost of using children as weapons. The retro terminal aesthetic reflects NERV's bureaucratic military nature—you're not a hero, you're middle management trying to save the world while filing budget reports.
